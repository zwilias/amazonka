-- | Creates a value of 'LogStream' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'lsCreationTime' - The creation time of the stream, expressed as the number of milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.
--
-- * 'lsUploadSequenceToken' - The sequence token.
--
-- * 'lsArn' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the log stream.
--
-- * 'lsFirstEventTimestamp' - The time of the first event, expressed as the number of milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.
--
-- * 'lsLogStreamName' - The name of the log stream.
--
-- * 'lsStoredBytes' - The number of bytes stored.
--
-- * 'lsLastIngestionTime' - The ingestion time, expressed as the number of milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.
--
-- * 'lsLastEventTimestamp' - the time of the most recent log event in the log stream in CloudWatch Logs. This number is expressed as the number of milliseconds after Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. lastEventTime updates on an eventual consistency basis. It typically updates in less than an hour from ingestion, but may take longer in some rare situations.
