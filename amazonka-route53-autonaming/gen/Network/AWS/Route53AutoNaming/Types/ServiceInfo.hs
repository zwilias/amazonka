-- | Creates a value of 'ServiceInfo' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'siInstanceCount' - The number of instances that are currently associated with the service. Instances that were previously associated with the service but that have been deleted are not included in the count.
--
-- * 'siARN' - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that Route 53 assigns to the service when you create it.
--
-- * 'siHealthCheckConfig' - /Public DNS namespaces only./ A complex type that contains settings for an optional health check. If you specify settings for a health check, Route 53 associates the health check with all the records that you specify in @DnsConfig@ . For information about the charges for health checks, see <http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing Route 53 Pricing> .
--
-- * 'siCreatorRequestId' - A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of executing the operation twice. @CreatorRequestId@ can be any unique string, for example, a date/time stamp.
--
-- * 'siCreateDate' - The date and time that the service was created, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of @CreateDate@ is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value @1516925490.087@ represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.
--
-- * 'siHealthCheckCustomConfig' - Undocumented member.
--
-- * 'siName' - The name of the service.
--
-- * 'siId' - The ID that Route 53 assigned to the service when you created it.
--
-- * 'siDNSConfig' - A complex type that contains information about the records that you want Route 53 to create when you register an instance.
--
-- * 'siDescription' - The description of the service.
