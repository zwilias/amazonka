-- This implementation of the DELETE operation uses the policy subresource to delete the policy of a specified bucket. If you are using an identity other than the root user of the AWS account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the @DeleteBucketPolicy@ permissions on the specified bucket and belong to the bucket owner's account to use this operation. 
--
--
-- If you don't have @DeleteBucketPolicy@ permissions, Amazon S3 returns a @403 Access Denied@ error. If you have the correct permissions, but you're not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a @405 Method Not Allowed@ error. 
--
-- /Important:/ As a security precaution, the root user of the AWS account that owns a bucket can always use this operation, even if the policy explicitly denies the root user the ability to perform this action.
