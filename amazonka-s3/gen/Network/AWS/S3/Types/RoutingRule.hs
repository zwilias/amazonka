-- | Creates a value of 'RoutingRule' with the minimum fields required to make a request.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'rrCondition' - A container for describing a condition that must be met for the specified redirect to apply. For example, 1. If request is for pages in the @/docs@ folder, redirect to the @/documents@ folder. 2. If request results in HTTP error 4xx, redirect request to another host where you might process the error.
--
-- * 'rrRedirect' - Container for redirect information. You can redirect requests to another host, to another page, or with another protocol. In the event of an error, you can specify a different error code to return.
